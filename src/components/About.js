        <p className="about-content">I'm a junior developer living and working in Vancouver, BC. In 2016 I moved here from Charlottetown, PEI to attend <a href="lighthouselabs.ca" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lighthouse Labs'</a> full-stack web development bootcamp, and for the last year I've been working as a web developer in Vancouver. Before that I got a history degree from the University of Prince Edward Island, taught English in France for a year, and started my own pedicab tour business.</p>
